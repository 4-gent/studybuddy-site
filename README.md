# studybuddy-site

site code and markup

//What this is
This is the repository for the studybuddy site where the team can create and upload new versions which end up becoming a part of the main branch

Whenever we need to update the whole site we release new updates through here and upload the repository into the compute engine which will allow us to update everything.

For those who have not worked with github, you'll all have to learn how to make new branches, upload files, and use git to download files through the command line
